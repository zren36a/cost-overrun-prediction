Keywords: 
Construction cost optimization, predictive analytics, data-driven project management

Description:
The construction industry frequently faces cost overruns due to various factors, including inaccurate estimates, resource misallocation, and unforeseen circumstances. This project aims to apply predictive analytics to optimize construction project costs by analyzing historical data from past projects. Key questions include identifying the most significant drivers of cost overruns and how predictive models can improve budget forecasting. The project will focus on analyzing factors such as labor costs, material prices, and project timelines, with the goal of generating insights that construction managers can use to improve budget accuracy and reduce costs. The project will be data-driven, using construction cost data from public sources to identify trends and forecast future expenses.

Intellectual Merit:
This project has the potential to discover new insights into the underlying causes of cost overruns in construction projects. By applying data science methods to recent data, the project can advance current knowledge in the field of cost management. The predictive models developed will help improve cost estimation accuracy, providing construction project managers with actionable insights to better control project budgets. This will contribute to improving efficiency in an industry that regularly suffers from budget excesses.

Data Sourcing:
The data for this project will be sourced from publicly available databases such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which provides detailed data on labor costs, material prices, and other construction-related costs. Additionally, reports from industry organizations and construction firms will provide supplementary data. The datasets used should be from the year 2024, ensuring the data is recent and relevant.
