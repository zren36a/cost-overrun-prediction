Keywords: 
Engineering and Construction, cost overrun, predictive analytics, data-driven project management

Description:
The engineering and construction industry frequently faces cost overruns due to various factors, including inaccurate estimates, resource misallocation, and unforeseen circumstances. This project aims to apply predictive analytics to optimize construction project costs by analyzing historical data from past projects. Key questions include identifying the most significant drivers of cost overruns and how predictive models can improve budget forecasting. The project will focus on analyzing factors such as scope of work, contract amount and project timelines, with the goal of generating insights that construction managers can use to improve budget accuracy and reduce costs. The project will be data-driven, using engineering and construction cost data from public sources to identify trends and forecast future expenses.

Research Questions

RO1: To describe the trends within data on how the project cost changed (budget vs actual) in relation to its scope of work, contract amount and project timelines..

RO2: To predict if an project will be cost overrun based on its scope of work,contract amount and project timelines.

RO3: To defend the model for performing the prediction of potentially overrun project using correct accuracy metrics and validation.

RO4: To evaluate causal relationships implied by the RO2 model regarding what attributes have most effect on a project being potentially cost overrun or not.


Intellectual Merit:
This project has the potential to discover new insights into the underlying causes of cost overruns in engineering and construction projects. By applying data science methods to recent data, the project can advance current knowledge in the field of cost management. The predictive models developed will help improve cost estimation accuracy, providing engineering & construction management authorities and project managers with actionable insights to better control project budgets. This will contribute to improving efficiency in an industry that regularly suffers from budget excesses.

Data Sourcing:
The data for this project will be sourced from publicly available databases such as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which provides detailed data on labor costs, material prices, and other construction-related costs. Additionally, reports from industry organizations and construction firms will provide supplementary data. The datasets used should be from the year 2024, ensuring the data is recent and relevant.
